  <i>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey XI:
  Stellar Mass Fractions and Luminosity Functions of MaDCoWS Clusters
  at z∼1</i></h3>
  <p><b>Abstract</b><br>
  We present stellar mass fractions and composite luminosity functions (LFs) for a sample of 12 clusters from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS) at a redshift range of 0.951≤z≤1.43. Using SED fitting of optical and deep mid-infrared photometry, we establish the membership of objects along the lines-of-sight to these clusters and calculate the stellar masses of member galaxies. We find stellar mass fractions for these clusters largely consistent with previous works, including appearing to display a negative correlation with total cluster mass. We measure a composite 3.6 μm LF down to m∗+2.5 for all 12 clusters. Fitting a Schechter function to the LF, we find a characteristic 3.6 μm magnitude of m∗=19.83±0.12 and faint-end slope of α=−0.81±0.10 for the full sample at a mean redshift of z¯=1.18. We also divide the clusters into high- and low-redshift bins at z¯=1.29 and z¯=1.06 respectively and measure a composite LF for each bin. We see a small, but statistically significant evolution in m∗ and α&#8212;consistent with passive evolution&#8212;when we study the joint fit to the two parameters, which is probing the evolution of faint cluster galaxies at z∼1. This highlights the importance of deep IR data in studying the evolution of cluster galaxy populations at high-redshift.</p>

  <i>The Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey. VI. Stellar Mass
  Fractions of a Sample of High-redshift Infrared-selected
  Clusters</i></h3>
  <p><b>Abstract</b><br>
  We present measurements of the stellar mass fractions ({f}\star ) for a sample of high-redshift (0.93 ≤ z ≤ 1.32) infrared-selected galaxy clusters from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS) and compare them to the stellar mass fractions of Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) effect-selected clusters in a similar mass and redshift range from the South Pole Telescope (SPT)-SZ Survey. We do not find a significant difference in mean {f}\star between the two selection methods; though, we do find an unexpectedly large range in {f}\star for the SZ-selected clusters. In addition, we measure the luminosity function of the MaDCoWS clusters and find {m}* =19.41+/- 0.07, similar to other studies of clusters at or near our redshift range. Finally, we present SZ detections and masses for seven MaDCoWS clusters and new spectroscopic redshifts for five MaDCoWS clusters. One of these new clusters, MOO J1521+0452 at z = 1.31, is the most distant MaDCoWS cluster confirmed to date.</p>
