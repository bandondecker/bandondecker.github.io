<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am an astronomer at the University of Missouri&#8212;Kansas City
and recently graduated with a PhD in astronomy. I am
also a part of the <a
href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..240...33G/abstract"
target_blank>Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey</a> (MaDCoWS)
collaboration, studying high-redshift infrared-selected galaxy
clusters. MaDCoWS is a large-area infrared survey, using
all-sky WISE data and optical survey data to identify overdensities of
galaxies at z~1. MaDCoWS is the only all-sky cluster survey at this
redshift, and as such is sensitive to some of the most massive objects
in the universe at this redshift.</p>

<p>My dissertation work has focussed on the stellar mass
properties of a subset of MaDCoWS clusters at z~1.1. Using a
combination of mid-infrared data from the <i>Spitzer Space
telescope</i> and optical data from the GMOS cameras on the Gemini
telescopes, I measured stellar mass fractions and deep luminosity
functions for this subset of infrared-selected MaDCoWS clusters. I
compared the stellar mass fractions as a function of total mass to the
same measurements of ICM-selected clusters from the South Pole
Telescope survey. Because infrared luminosity is directly related to
stellar mass, it was possible that MaDCoWS clusters would be biased
toward finding clusters with more stellar mass than ICM-selected
clusters. I did not find a large difference in the stellar mass
fractions, however, with only a hint that there might be more scatter
in the SPT clusters. My study of the luminosity functions showed a
similar consistency between MaDCoWS clusters and previous
surveys. Using an algorithm to jointly fit the properties of the
Schechter function, I found there was significant evolution, but that
the evolution was consistent with passive evolution. Importantly, this
evolution was only detectable when performing a <i>simultaneous</i>
fit to the Schechter function parameters.</p>

<p>I'm an expert in both optical and radio data reduction, having done
both extensively for MaDCoWS. I developed the reduction pipeline for
the MaDCoWS Gemini observations, writing a script to reduce the raw
GMOS imaging, apply the necessary astrometric corrections, and create
a multi-band optical catalogue. This has evolved considerably over
time, going from IRAF to Python, and also calling SCAMP, SWarp and
SExtractor. I have also travelled to Las Campanas Observatory twice to
take data for MaDCoWS with the Magellan telescopes. I have been
heavily involved in applying for and reducing interferometric radio
data for MaDCoWS. I used CARMA SZ data to measure the masses of
several of the clusters in my 2019 paper, as well as the mass of MOO
J1142+1527, the most massive cluster yet discovered at z > 1.15. I was
also a part of the successful MaDCoWS ALMA proposal, and performed the
initial reduction of those data. Since then, I have been to the
single-dish Green Bank Observatory twice and am a certified remote
observer. I have been one of the observers on all of the MaDCoWS GBT
projects.</p>

<p>As is hinted at above, I am an extremely talented programmer. In
addition to the aforementioned Gemini reduction pipeline, I wrote a
Bayesian fitting algorithm to more quickly perform the joint fit of
the Schechter function required for my dissertation work. There are a
huge number of other scripts that go into my work as well. By the time
I finished it, the entire analysis and output plots for my second
paper could be done and generated with barely more than one line of
input at the terminal! I am familiar with many computer learning
algorithms as well; some of my initial analyses have made use of them
and they are very promising for future classification work. Currently,
I am helping teach the Department of Physics and Astronomy Research
Training Skills course. This is a course designed to cover the basics
of Python programming and data analysis for aspiring undergrad
researchers.</p>

<p>I'm originally from the Kansas City area and I got my Bachelor's
degree in physics from Truman State University in Kirksville,
MO. Although it is very hard to find a suitably dark sky in Kansas
City, I enjoy talking about astronomy and host occasional outreach
events. Outside of astronomy I have a great love of sport, in
particular baseball and cricket. I am a lifelong (and
intermittently-suffering) Royals fan as well as a supporter of
Lancashire and England. Most of my <a
href="https://twitter.com/Bandon_Decker" target_blank>Twitter</a>
rants and rambles are about that, though I do also try to use it for
some outreach, particularly pertaining to my work. I also do some
recreational Python coding, and enjoy hiking, playing golf, and
generally spending time outdoors, particularly with my significant
other.</p> </div> </section>
