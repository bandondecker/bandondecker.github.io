<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a former astronomer with a PhD in Physics and Computer Science
  from the University of Missouri&#8212;Kansas City.As an academic, I was part of the <a
href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..240...33G/abstract"
target_blank>Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey</a> (MaDCoWS)
collaboration, studying high-redshift infrared-selected galaxy
clusters. MaDCoWS is a large-area infrared survey, using
all-sky WISE data and optical survey data to identify overdensities of
galaxies at z~1. MaDCoWS is the only all-sky cluster survey at this
redshift, and as such is sensitive to some of the most massive objects
  in the universe at this redshift.</p>

<p>My dissertation work focussed on the stellar mass
properties of a subset of MaDCoWS clusters at z~1.1. Using a
combination of mid-infrared data from the <i>Spitzer Space
telescope</i> and optical data from the GMOS cameras on the Gemini
telescopes, I measured stellar mass fractions and deep luminosity
functions for this subset of infrared-selected MaDCoWS clusters. I
compared the stellar mass fractions as a function of total mass to the
same measurements of ICM-selected clusters from the South Pole
Telescope survey. Because infrared luminosity is directly related to
stellar mass, it was possible that MaDCoWS clusters would be biased
toward finding clusters with more stellar mass than ICM-selected
clusters. I did not find a large difference in the stellar mass
fractions, however, with only a hint that there might be more scatter
in the SPT clusters. My study of the luminosity functions showed a
similar consistency between MaDCoWS clusters and previous
surveys. Using an algorithm to jointly fit the properties of the
Schechter function, I found there was significant evolution, but that
the evolution was consistent with passive evolution. Importantly, this
evolution was only detectable when performing a <i>simultaneous</i>
fit to the Schechter function parameters.</p>

<p>I'm an expert in both optical and radio data reduction, having done
both extensively for MaDCoWS. I developed the reduction pipeline for
the MaDCoWS Gemini observations, writing a script to reduce the raw
GMOS imaging, apply the necessary astrometric corrections, and create
a multi-band optical catalogue. This has evolved considerably over
time, going from IRAF to Python, and also calling SCAMP, SWarp and
SExtractor. I have also travelled to Las Campanas Observatory twice to
take data for MaDCoWS with the Magellan telescopes. I have been
heavily involved in applying for and reducing interferometric radio
data for MaDCoWS. I used CARMA SZ data to measure the masses of
several of the clusters in my 2019 paper, as well as the mass of MOO
J1142+1527, the most massive cluster yet discovered at z > 1.15. I was
also a part of the successful MaDCoWS ALMA proposal, and performed the
initial reduction of those data. Since then, I have been to the
single-dish Green Bank Observatory twice and am a certified remote
observer. I have been one of the observers on all of the MaDCoWS GBT
projects.</p>

<p>As is hinted at above, I am an extremely talented programmer. In
addition to the aforementioned Gemini reduction pipeline, I wrote a
Bayesian fitting algorithm to more quickly perform the joint fit of
the Schechter function required for my dissertation work. There are a
huge number of other scripts that go into my work as well. By the time
I finished it, the entire analysis and output plots for my second
paper could be done and generated with barely more than one line of
input at the terminal! I am familiar with many computer learning
algorithms as well; some of my initial analyses have made use of them
and they are very promising for future classification work. In my last
year in academia, I also taught the Department of Physics and
Astronomy Research Training Skills course. This is a course designed
to cover the basics of Python programming and data analysis for
aspiring undergrad researchers.</p>

<p>I'm now a senior data scientist with a life insurance firm
focussing on term life insurance policies. Most of my work is using
our internal datasets to build machine learning models of our internal
processes, to see if we can predict potential delays to customer
service before they happen. I also work collaboratively with a few
other departments to try to solve odd problems or do a more detailed
analysis on something than is usually possible. This makes for very
interesting, quite varied work that I enjoy immensely and I still get
to bring my scientific experience to bear. I also get to flex my
experience making and giving presentations, which always goes down well!</p>

 <p>Before my current role, I worked in the geospatial industry on
  a project that used infrared images from drones to find areas of
  concrete delamination in highway bridges. It was an interesting
  application of basic scientific principles, and I enjoyed using my
  background in astronomy and infrared imaging to guide the research
  stage of the project from a disjointed series of coding libraries to
  a full data reduction and analysis pipeline. I would have liked to
  have done a bit more with it, but there were other factors that made
  finishing the project impossible and anyway I am much happier in my
  current role.<p>

<!-- <p>Between academia and industry I now have ten years of experience
  working directly with imaging data as well as analysing and
  modelling large and often disparate data sets. I work primarily in
  python and I have over a decade of experience doing scientific
  computing, including implementing standard machine learning models
  in python. Part of my work with Alynix has been to migrate our
  pipeline to a cloud-based approach using AWS S3 and EC2, and I am
  also the owner of the Alynix GitHub repositories.</p> -->

<p>I'm originally from the Kansas City area and I got my Bachelor's
degree in physics from Truman State University in Kirksville,
MO. Although it is very hard to find a suitably dark sky in Kansas
City, I enjoy talking about astronomy and host occasional outreach
events. Outside of astronomy I have a great love of sport, in
particular baseball and cricket. I am a lifelong (and
intermittently-suffering) Royals fan as well as a supporter of
Lancashire and England. I don't have a lot of spare brain-power after
work, but I love digging into baseball statistics, and I am trying to
get back into the habit of blogging statistical analyses. I find a lot
of discourse around advanced metrics could use a scientific approach!
Most of the projects that I will publish here will be blending python
and baseball, though I am also looking more into historical astronomy
and academia as part of a hobby group.</p> </div> </section>
