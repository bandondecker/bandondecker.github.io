<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am an astronomer currently at the University of
Missouri&#8212;Kansas City, finishing my doctoral work and scheduled
to graduate in spring of 2022. I am a part of the <a
href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..240...33G/abstract"
target_blank>Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey</a> (MaDCoWS)
collaboration, studying high-redshift infrared-selected galaxy
clusters, including some of the most massive clusters in the universe
at redshift z~1. I have been studying the evolution of clusters at this
stage of the universe using measurements of the total mass and stellar
mass of the clusters. Through analysis of the stellar mass fractions
and the luminosity functions of MaDCoWS clusters, I have found that
there is not a significant difference in composition between
infrared-selected and ICM-selected clusters (though merging clusters
complicate this) and that the MaDCoWS clusters appear to be evolving
passively.</p>

<p>As part of my research, I have also been heavily involved with
data reduction for MaDCoWS. I have built the pipelines to reduce
Gemini GMOS imaging (through multiple iterations as their software has
changed) and have produced multi-wavelength catalogues from GMOS and
<i>Spitzer</i>/IRAC images. I have also reduced Sunyaev Zel'dovich
data from the now-defunct Combined Array for Research in
Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) and been involved in reducing data
from the Alma Atacama Compact Array (ACA).</p>

<p>I'm originally from the Kansas City area and I got my Bachelor's
degree in physics from Truman State University in Kirksville,
MO. Although it is very hard to find a suitably dark sky in Kansas
City, I enjoy talking about astronomy and host occasional outreach
events. Outside of astronomy I have a great love of sport, in particular
baseball and cricket. I am a lifelong (and intermittently-suffering)
Royals fan as well as a supporter of Lancashire and England. Most of
my <a href="https://twitter.com/Bandon_Decker"
target_blank>Twitter</a> rants and rambles are about one of these
sides, though I do also try to use it for some outreach, particularly
pertaining to my work. I also do some recreational python coding,
watching sartirical comedy, and hiking, particularly with my
significant other.</p>
