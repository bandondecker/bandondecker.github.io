  <h1>Bandon Decker, PhD</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I am a data scientist and former astronomer ('ex-tronomer') with a PhD in Physics and Computer Science from the University of Missouri---Kansas City. I'm currently working in the geospatial industry, on a project using drone-based infrared imagery to detect concrete delamination in highway bridges. My dissertation work involved analysing a very heterogenous data set from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS). A lot of this was also infrared imagery---I went from infrared cameras on the ground looking at the sky, to infrared cameras in the sky looking at the ground!</p>

<p>Between my academic and industry backgrounds I have over a decade of experience doing scientific analysis in python and nearly a decade of experience working directly with image data. I also have several years of experience analysing and modelling large data sets---including machine learning analyses---and visualising and presenting these analyses to varied audiences. More recently I have worked increasingly in AWS environments and am familiar with git, git flow, and GitHub.</p>

  <p>On this site, you can find my <a href='cv.html'>CV</a>, a <a
  href='about.html'>more detailed bio</a> and a link
  to my <a href='publications.html'>publications</a>.</p>
