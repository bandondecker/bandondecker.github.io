  <h1>Dr Bandon Decker</h1>
  <br>
  <p>I am a data scientist and former astronomer ('ex-tronomer') with
  a PhD from the University of Missouri&#8212;Kansas City. My research
  focussed on the stellar mass fractions of galaxy clusters from the
  Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS). Most of the
  data I used was infrared imagery, but I also had optical and radio
  data, making for a varied dataset! Since leaving academia, I have
  worked in the geospatial industry (also with infrared data, just
  looking at the ground from the sky instead of looking at the sky
  from the ground!) Now I work for a life insurance firm trying to
  improve internal processes and looking into whatever other fun
  problems might come up.</p>

<p>Between my academic and industry backgrounds I have over a decade of experience doing scientific analysis in python and nearly a decade of experience working directly with image data. I also have several years of experience analysing and modelling large data sets---including machine learning analyses---and visualising and presenting these analyses to varied audiences.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, this site started as a professional showcase, and
  it still is. If you read through it is still very heavily focusses
  on my professional experience and abilities. But I am expanding it
  to include some more from my hobbies. I still do astronomy outreach
  and also dabble in historical astronomy, but mostly I like to blend
  programming with my love of baseball. Here you can find links to my
  <a href='projects.html'>projects</a> (right now only one is
  published), a <a href='about.html'>more detailed bio</a>, my <a
  href='cv.html'>CV</a>, and a link to my <a
  href='publications.html'>publications</a>.</p>
