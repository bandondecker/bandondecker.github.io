<p>This is where I'm providing links and a bit of information about all the projects I am working on that I think are reasonably usable. Most of this will be on <a href="https://github.com/bandondecker?tab=repositories" target=_blank>my GitHub</a>, and you can see the work-in-progress there too, but I'm planning to keep this page as the most up-to-date list of what is actually ready for release as opposed to only usable by me.</p>

<div class="section-inner">
  <h3><a
  href="https://github.com/bandondecker/Scorecard/releases/tag/v1.2.0"
  target=_blank>Scorecard</a></h3>
  <p>This is a set of Python code for creating a double-sided scorecard. It's designed for my style, but it works pretty broadly. The main feature of this is that although it can create a generic blank scorecard, it can also read in a file to create a scorecard specific to one game. (Part of the ongoing update work on this is making this file a bit more user-friendly.)</p>
  <p>Like a lot of what I build in Python, this is set up to be run from a BASH terminal. A future update might make it more compatible with Windows.</p>

<section id="Printable Schedule">
<div class="section-inner">
  <h3><a
  href="https://github.com/bandondecker"
  target=_blank>Printable Schedule</a></h3>
  <p>This is code to take in a text baseball schedule&#8212;specifically the CSV schedules on the official team websites&#8212;and displaying them in a calendar format, with a decent amount of customisation. This was borne out of a desire to highlight individual games on a calendar schedule ahead of time, usually because they were in my season ticket package, but the code has expanded significantly from there. A likely future update (<i>maybe</i> before the 2026 season?) will be to make it more usable for other sports as well.</p>
  <p>I'm not including a real link yet because this is only usable in the loosest sense of the word. But the next project release is going to be a hopefully <i>somewhat</i> user-friendly version of this, well before the 2026 season starts.</p>
